Q.1. What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?

A.1. Spatial locality refers to the use of data in relatively close storage locations,
such as a cache, rather than referencing a larger storage location at a further distance,
like the RAM. Accessing the data from a closer and smaller storage location allows us to
sort through the data faster since there is less to sort through, and it is closer to reach,
hence a faster result.

Q.2. Compare the performance of an Array to a Linked List using the Benchmark module.
  - Compare the time it takes to create a 10,000 item Array to appending 10,000 items
    to a Linked List.

      array: 0.000071
      linked list: 2.047878

  - Compare the time it takes to access the 5000th element of the Array and the 5000th
    Node in the Linked List.

      array: 0.000026
      linked list: 0.000629

  - Compare the time it takes to remove the 5000th element from the Array to removing
    the 5000th Node in the Linked List.

      array: 0.000067
      linked list: 0.000005
