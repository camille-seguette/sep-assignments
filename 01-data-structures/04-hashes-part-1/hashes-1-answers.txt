Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.

Doubling the size of the underlying array, as opposed to increasing it by the 2nd power, can
potentially be bad because it creates more extra space for the algorithm to sift through
which will lead to longer time spent running the code, and it separates each individual item
farther from each other than is necessary, also causing it to take longer to run.
