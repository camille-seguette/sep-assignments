1.Q: How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

2.Q: If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
2.A: A developer could iterate through the array to find a specific element in the data structure.

3.Q: What other real-world data can each structure represent?
3.A: Other real-world examples where a queue data structure could be represented would be in network printers where bluetooth technology communicates to a printer where documents are printed in the order in which they are received, or a line of vehicles at a toll booth.
